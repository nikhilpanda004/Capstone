Here's a high-level overview of the steps you could follow to build an NLP project to generate Cypher queries from natural 
language using pre-feed query templates:

Prepare a set of query templates: You would need to define a set of query templates for the different types of queries you want to generate. 
For example, if you want to generate queries for fetching data from a graph database, you could have a template like "Give me all the nodes of type X 
where Y is Z".

Tokenize the natural language input: In this step, you would convert the natural language input into tokens. This could be done using techniques 
such as word tokenization, sentence tokenization, or both.

Identify the intent of the query: Once you have the tokens, you need to identify the intent of the query, i.e., what the user wants to achieve 
through their query. This could be done using techniques such as intent classification, pattern matching, or a combination of both.

Map the tokens to the query template: Once you have identified the intent of the query, you can map the tokens to the corresponding query template. 
For example, if the intent is to fetch nodes of type X where Y is Z, you would replace the placeholders in the template with the actual values of 
X, Y, and Z from the tokens.

Validate and execute the generated query: Finally, you would validate the generated query to ensure that it is syntactically correct, and then 
execute it against the graph database to get the results.

These are the high-level steps involved in building an NLP project to generate Cypher queries. The actual implementation would depend 
on the specific requirements of your project, the tools and libraries available, and your own preferences.



Here's a more detailed example of how you could build an NLP project to generate Cypher queries using the tools and libraries available:

1.Prepare a set of query templates: As mentioned earlier, you need to define a set of query templates for the different types of queries you want to generate. For example, you could have the following templates:

template_1 = "MATCH (n:`X`) WHERE n.`Y` = '`Z`' RETURN n"
template_2 = "MATCH (n:`X`)-[r:`R`]->(m:`M`) WHERE n.`Y` = '`Z`' RETURN n, r, m"


2.Tokenize the natural language input: For this step, you could use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python, which provides a variety of tools for natural language processing. For example, to tokenize a sentence into words, you could use the word_tokenize() function:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

sentence = "Give me all the nodes of type Person where name is Alice"
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
print(tokens)


3. Identify the intent of the query: In this step, you could use intent classification techniques to identify the intent of the query. For example, you could use the scikit-learn library in Python to train a simple machine learning model for intent classification:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Training data
X_train = ["Give me all the nodes of type Person where name is Alice", 
           "Find all the nodes of type Movie where release year is 2020", 
           "Get all the nodes of type Book where author is Jane Austen"]
y_train = [1, 2, 3]

# Vectorize the training data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Train the intent classification model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)


4. Map the tokens to the query template: Once you have identified the intent of the query, you can use the tokens to fill in the placeholders in the corresponding query template. For example:

def map_tokens_to_template(tokens, intent):
    if intent == 1:
        template = template_1
    elif intent == 2:
        template = template_2
    else:
        template = None
    
    if template is not None:
        for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
            if token == "type":
                X = tokens[i+1]
            if token == "where":
                Y = tokens[i+1]
                Z = tokens[i+3]
        query = template.replace("`X`", X).replace("`Y`", Y).replace("`Z`", Z)
