Here's a high-level overview of the steps you could follow to build an NLP project to generate Cypher queries from natural language using pre-feed query templates:

Prepare a set of query templates: You would need to define a set of query templates for the different types of queries you want to generate. For example, if you want to generate queries for fetching data from a graph database, you could have a template like "Give me all the nodes of type X where Y is Z".

Tokenize the natural language input: In this step, you would convert the natural language input into tokens. This could be done using techniques such as word tokenization, sentence tokenization, or both.

Identify the intent of the query: Once you have the tokens, you need to identify the intent of the query, i.e., what the user wants to achieve through their query. This could be done using techniques such as intent classification, pattern matching, or a combination of both.

Map the tokens to the query template: Once you have identified the intent of the query, you can map the tokens to the corresponding query template. For example, if the intent is to fetch nodes of type X where Y is Z, you would replace the placeholders in the template with the actual values of X, Y, and Z from the tokens.

Validate and execute the generated query: Finally, you would validate the generated query to ensure that it is syntactically correct, and then execute it against the graph database to get the results.

These are the high-level steps involved in building an NLP project to generate Cypher queries. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of your project, the tools and libraries available, and your own preferences.
